This repository contains the R markdown document for the final project to complete the Practical Machine Learning course of Coursera.

## IMPORTANT NOTE: I apologize upfront because I could not generate an HTML file. I work directly with RStudio configured to work in a server. I just found out that I am missing the pango cairo library, which makes impossible to generate reports using knit. See the following information:

# I contacted our IT people but this will be solved next week.
#So I hope you can grade me by checking my Rmarkdown document. Thanks in advance!
